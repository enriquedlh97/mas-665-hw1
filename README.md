# Enrique Crew AI System

A multi-agent CrewAI system that represents Enrique as an AI Studio student, capable of scheduling meetings, answering questions, and managing calendar availability through Calendly integration.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This system implements a **Backend Crew AI Agent** with multiple specialized agents that work together to:

1. **Chat with users** and understand their intent
2. **Check Enrique's Calendly availability** for requested dates/ranges
3. **Book meetings** after collecting required information
4. **Answer questions** about Enrique's background and interests

## 🤖 Agents

### 1. Chat Agent (Coordinator)
- **Role**: First contact and conversation orchestrator
- **Goal**: Understand user intent and delegate appropriate tasks
- **Capabilities**: Intent detection, conversation flow management, task delegation

### 2. Availability Agent
- **Role**: Calendar availability specialist
- **Goal**: Check Enrique's Calendly for available time slots
- **Capabilities**: Date range queries, alternative suggestions, slot formatting

### 3. Scheduler Agent
- **Role**: Meeting booking specialist
- **Goal**: Book meetings and provide confirmation details
- **Capabilities**: Contact collection, booking processing, confirmation management

### 4. Persona Agent
- **Role**: Enrique's personal representative
- **Goal**: Answer questions about Enrique's background and interests
- **Capabilities**: Bio information, project details, availability policies

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Backend Abstraction
- **Playwright MCP Integration**: Direct web automation for Calendly interaction
- **Modular Design**: Easy to swap backends (Calendly API ↔ Playwright MCP)
- **Stable Data Contracts**: Consistent interfaces for slot and booking data

### Key Features
- **Terminal Interface**: Clean CLI with special commands (`:help`, `:reset`, `:debug`)
- **Docker Environment**: Complete containerized setup with UV package management
- **Environment Configuration**: Flexible settings via environment variables
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and user-friendly error messages

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- OpenAI API key
- Playwright MCP server (running locally)

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mas-665-hw1
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration:
# - OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
# - CALENDLY_LINK=https://calendly.com/your-handle/30min
# - MCP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Start the System
```bash
# Option 1: Using Make
make start

# Option 2: Direct Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build
```

### 4. Interact with the System
```bash
# The terminal interface will start automatically
# Try these example interactions:

# Check availability
"I'd like to schedule a meeting with Enrique"

# Learn about Enrique
"Tell me about Enrique's background"

# Check specific availability
"Is Enrique available this Friday afternoon?"
```

## 📋 Usage Examples
