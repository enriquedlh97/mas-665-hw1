# Enrique Crew AI System

A multi-agent CrewAI system that represents Enrique as an AI Studio student, capable of answering questions about his background and interests. Future capabilities will include scheduling meetings through Calendly.

## üéØ Project Overview

This system implements a **CrewAI agent** that acts as a digital persona for Enrique. The primary goal is to create a conversational experience where users can interact with Enrique's AI counterpart to learn about his skills, projects, and background, with a near-term goal of integrating automated scheduling.

The current architecture is centered around a single, highly capable **Persona Agent**.

## ü§ñ Agent Architecture: Single Agent with Tools

We have adopted a simplified and robust architecture consisting of a single primary agent equipped with a suite of specialized tools. This approach centralizes the agent's logic and makes it easier to manage and extend.

### **Persona Agent**
- **Role**: Enrique's personal representative.
- **Goal**: To act as Enrique, answer questions about his background, and manage conversation flow.
- **Tools**:
    - `PersonaReaderTool`: Accesses a knowledge base (`persona.md`) to answer questions about Enrique's background, skills, and interests.
    - `CalendarCheckerTool`: Checks Enrique's calendar for availability (currently a placeholder).
    - `MeetingBookerTool`: Books meetings on Enrique's calendar (currently a placeholder).

This architecture allows the `PersonaAgent` to handle a wide variety of tasks by selecting the appropriate tool based on the user's intent.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Backend Abstraction
- **Playwright MCP Integration**: Direct web automation for Calendly interaction using [Microsoft's official Playwright MCP server](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp). This is planned for future integration.
- **Modular Design**: The system is designed to allow for easy swapping of backends (e.g., from a placeholder tool to a live Calendly API or Playwright).
- **Self-Contained**: Includes the Playwright MCP server as a git submodule for complete portability.

### Key Features
- **Terminal Interface**: A clean command-line interface for interacting with the agent.
- **Stateful Conversations**: The agent leverages CrewAI's memory to remember the context of the conversation.
- **Docker Environment**: The entire system is containerized with Docker and uses UV for fast and reliable package management.
- **Environment Configuration**: All settings, including API keys and model preferences, are managed through environment variables.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git (for submodule support)
- OpenAI API key
- Calendly account with a public booking link

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mas-665-hw1

# Complete initial setup (submodules + build)
make setup
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration:
# - OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
# - CALENDLY_LINK=https://calendly.com/your-handle/30min
```

### 3. Start the System

#### üöÄ **Daily Usage (Recommended)**
```bash
# Complete workflow: Build + Start + Chat
make start-chat
```

#### ‚ö° **Fast Daily Usage (After Initial Build)**
```bash
# Quick start: Start + Chat (no rebuild)
make quick-chat
```

#### üîß **Development Workflow**
```bash
# One-time setup (first time only)
make setup

# Daily usage (fast)
make quick-chat

# When you make code changes
make build
make quick-chat
```

#### üìã **Step-by-Step Commands**
```bash
# Three-step process (if you prefer)
make build    # Build images
make start    # Start services in background
make chat     # Open chat interface
```

**Note**: `make setup` builds everything once. After that, `make quick-chat` is fast (~10 seconds)!

### 4. Interact with the System
```bash
# The terminal interface will start automatically
# Try these example interactions:

# Check availability
"I'd like to schedule a meeting with Enrique"

# Learn about Enrique
"Tell me about Enrique's background"

# Check specific availability
"Is Enrique available this Friday afternoon?"
```

## üìã Usage Examples

### Booking a Meeting
```
You: I'd like to schedule a meeting with Enrique
Assistant: I understand you'd like to schedule a meeting with Enrique.
Do you have a specific date or time in mind, or would you like me to check his availability for this week?

You: This Friday afternoon
Assistant: Available time slots:
1. Friday, January 17 at 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM
2. Friday, January 17 at 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM
...

You: 1

```

### Natural Exit
```
You: That's all for today, thanks!
Assistant: You're very welcome! It was great helping you today.

| `make quick-chat` | ~10 seconds | Daily usage (fast!) |
| `make build` | ~2 minutes | After code changes |
| `make chat` | Instant | When services already running |

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key for LLM | Required |
| `CALENDLY_LINK` | Enrique's public Calendly link | Required |
| `MCP_SERVER_URL` | Playwright MCP server URL | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `TIMEZONE` | Timezone for scheduling | `America/New_York` |
| `BOOKING_BACKEND` | Backend to use | `playwright_mcp` |
| `DEBUG` | Enable debug mode | `false` |

### Special Commands
- `:help` - Show available commands
- `:reset` - Clear conversation state
- `:debug` - Show current conversation state
- `:quit` - Exit the application

### Natural Exit
The agent intelligently recognizes when you want to end the conversation. You can express this in many ways:
- "That's all for today, thanks"
- "Thanks, I'm good"
- "That's everything I needed"
- "Ok that's all thanks"
- "I'm done"
- "Goodbye"
- "See you later"

The agent uses natural language understanding to detect your intent to end the conversation, even if you don't explicitly say "exit" or "goodbye".

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**MCP Server Connection Failed**
```bash
# Check if MCP server is running
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Verify submodules are initialized
git submodule status

# Re-initialize submodules if needed
make setup

# Check Docker logs
docker-compose logs playwright-mcp
```

**OpenAI API Errors**
```bash
# Verify API key is set
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Check API key validity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" https://api.openai.com/v1/models
```

**Docker Build Issues**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
make clean
make build

# Or complete reset
make clean
make setup
```

**Slow Startup Issues**
```bash
# Make sure you're using the fast commands
make start-chat  # Fast (10 seconds)
# NOT: docker-compose up --build  # Slow (3+ minutes)

# If still slow, rebuild once
make build
make start-chat
```
